            **I'm Shraddha Shrestha**, your go-to Data Analyst, here to utilize the power of data to make a difference.
            "Without data, you're just another person with an opinion." We've all heard this, and honestly, it's kind of true. 
            In today's world, data isn't just powerful‚Äîit‚Äôs a game-changer. It can shape narratives, drive decisions, and sometimes 
            even cause chaos. That‚Äôs why I find it so fascinating.

        # Background and expertise
        st.markdown("""
            My journey into data started with a simple conversation during my undergrad with the CEO of ING Skills Academy, and 
            ever since, I‚Äôve been hooked. Now, as an MS Data Science student at the University of New Haven, I thrive on 
            turning raw data into meaningful insights through machine learning and AI. Because let‚Äôs be real‚Äîwith great algorithms 
            comes great responsibility! And let‚Äôs not forget‚Äîwithout proper data cleaning, all you have is garbage in, garbage out.
